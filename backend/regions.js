// Where American Rider operates: the registry of service regions.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (Chad, 9 Sept 2026): "think nationally — we start in Florida's tri-county
// area (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach), then Florida, then other states." Until this file
// the market was written into the code by hand in four places — a bounding box in market.js,
// the same box again in routes.js, the transit planner's address in transit.js and one
// county's fare table in smart.js — and opening the next region would have meant finding all
// four and hoping they were the only four. Now a region is one record here, and everything
// that depends on WHERE (the market gate, street routing, the transit planner, the bus
// allow-list, agency fares, government fees, the remittance calendar) reads it from the
// coordinates of the travel.
//
// A REGION IS
//   id        'fl-southeast'. Stable, lower-case, and the suffix of its environment variables:
//             OTP_URL_FL_SOUTHEAST, OSRM_URL_FL_SOUTHEAST.
//   bbox      the box a coordinate must fall inside to be served. A box rather than a polygon
//             on purpose: it is the same test market.js has always applied, it costs nothing,
//             and its edges fall on water or farmland where nobody is refused a travel that
//             could have been driven. Replace with a polygon when a region's edge is a city.
//   timezone  IANA name. The transit planner's OffsetDateTime and the monthly government-fee
//             remittance period both depend on it.
//   otpUrl    the OpenTripPlanner server that knows this region's streets and timetables:
//             OTP_URL_<ID>, then OTP_URL, then null. READ WHEN ASKED, NOT AT IMPORT — a value
//             set after startup (or by a test) must count, and a region with no planner must
//             say so rather than remember an old one.
//   osrmUrl   an OSRM server for street routing, same lookup. Without one, streets.js asks OTP.
//   transit.feeds     the GTFS feeds loaded into that OTP, by the feedId OTP prefixes onto
//             every identifier it returns ('MDT:31009'). fareCents is what a traveler pays the
//             agency for one boarding; null means the fare is not known here (zone- or
//             date-priced) and smart.js reports that rather than inventing a number. freeModes
//             lists our leg modes that ride free on that feed.
//   transit.frequentRoutesFile  the bus allow-list infra/otp/frequent-routes.mjs writes for
//             this region, relative to backend/. Without the file no bus is offered.
//
// ADDING A REGION is adding a record. The rest of the backend does not name a region anywhere.
//
// FARES, VERIFIED 9 SEPT 2026:
//   Miami-Dade Transit  $2.25 per boarding, Metrorail and Metrobus; Metromover and the MIA
//                       Mover are free (route_type 0, our mode 'tram').
//   Palm Tran           $2.00 "Single Trip" — palmtran.org/fares-passes, read on this date.
//   Broward County Transit  NOT CONFIRMED. broward.org/bct/fares renders its fare table by
//                       script and could not be read; the county fact-sheet PDF is gone (404).
//                       Search engines report $2.00 regular and $2.65 premium express, but a
//                       fare this app prints must come from the agency's own page. null until
//                       somebody reads it there — the leg is then reported as fareUnknown.
//   Tri-Rail, Brightline  zone- and date-priced respectively; never known here.

// ——— JURISDICTION: WHOSE LAW APPLIES, AND WHY IT IS A REGION FIELD ————————————————
//
// FOUND 20 SEPT 2026 BY SWEEPING FOR MARKET ASSUMPTIONS rather than by anybody reporting it.
// Seventeen strings in each of the five language catalogues name Florida or §627.748, and ten
// backend modules do — the insurance disclosure, the screening standard, the three-year
// re-check, the regulator an operator is told to verify a licence with, the words an operator
// reads out to an insurance agent.
//
// EVERY ONE OF THEM IS CORRECT TODAY AND WRONG THE DAY WE OPEN GEORGIA. And unlike a wrong
// destination list, which is an inconvenience, this is a legal failure in both directions: an
// operator in Georgia would be handed a disclosure citing a statute that does not govern them,
// and Georgia's own disclosure requirement would go unsatisfied. The §627.748(8)(a) gate at
// POST /operator/online would be enforcing the wrong state's rule against them.
//
// SO JURISDICTION IS A PROPERTY OF THE REGION, exactly as `timezone` already is, and for the
// same reason: it is a fact about WHERE, and the code that needs it should read it from the
// coordinates of the travel rather than know it.
//
// THE FIELD IS REQUIRED, AND regions.test.js FAILS WITHOUT IT. That is the point of adding it
// now rather than when the second state opens: a region cannot be added by copying this record
// and changing the box, because the copy would carry Florida's statute into another state
// silently. Adding a market now forces somebody to answer what that market's law requires.
//
// WHAT IS NOT YET DONE, stated so it is not mistaken for finished: the app's catalogues and
// the backend's disclosure text still contain Florida's words directly. Threading this record
// through them is the work; this is the record they will read. Until then, a second region
// must not be opened.
