// FOLLOWING A TRAVEL — the page a trusted contact opens.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Safe Travels offered "Share This Travel" and sent a sentence: a destination
// and a Travel Number. The card above it said "share your live location, operator, and arrival
// time", which was not true — there was no link, no position, and nothing to follow. A safety
// promise the product does not keep is worse than no promise, because a contact told they can
// follow a journey stops checking on the person taking it.
//
// THE TOKEN IS A BEARER CAPABILITY, and that is deliberate. A contact should not need an
// account, an app, or a password at the moment they are worried about somebody — they need a
// link that opens. So possession of the link is the authorisation, which puts the whole design
// weight on the token being unguessable and short-lived:
//
//   - 32 hex characters from crypto.randomBytes. Not a ride id, not derived from anything.
//   - Minted per share, never reused, and only while a travel is actually underway.
//   - Dies when the travel does. After completion the page says the travel ended and shows
//     nothing further — no position, no operator, no history.
//   - Hard expiry regardless, so a link that leaks cannot be replayed a week later against
//     some future travel.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SHOW: the traveler's name, their phone, their account, or any
// previous travel. A worried contact needs to know where the car is and who is driving it.
// Everything else is somebody's private life, and this page is public by construction.
