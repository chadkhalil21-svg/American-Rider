// Turning a place the traveler picked into the ONE all-in price they'll pay.

// TWO STEPS, and the second one is the important one:
//   1. Geocode — ask Apple where that place actually is (lat/lng). Happens on the phone.
//   2. Quote   — ask OUR SERVER what that trip costs. Happens on the server, always.
//
// The app never calculates a price. It only ever says WHERE the traveler is going. That is
// what stops a tampered copy of the app from deciding its own fare, and it is why the fare
// constants live in backend/fares.js and nowhere else.

// ——— WHERE A LOOSE SEARCH IS ANCHORED ——————————————————————————————————————————
//
// This was `const MARKET_SUFFIX = ', Miami, FL'` — appended to every loose search, for every
// traveler, everywhere. Adrian, 20 Sept 2026: "if someone opens the app in New York City, what
// would they see?" They would type "times square" and we would ask Apple for "times square,
// Miami, FL" FIRST. A traveler in Fort Lauderdale typing "las olas" — a street four miles from
// them, inside our own market — was asked about Miami before their own city.
//
// THE ANCHOR IS THE TRAVELER'S OWN CITY, read from their coordinates. It costs nothing (the
// device's own reverse geocoder), needs no service, no key and no rate limit, and it is
// correct in every city on earth rather than in one. Apple's geocoder has always been
// national; only this constant was not.
//
// A SEARCH IS THE MECHANISM; A LIST OF PLACES IS NOT. Anything curated by hand is a cost that
// grows with every market and is maintained, at the fiftieth city, by nobody. backend/places.js
// exists as a first-run affordance for launch markets — a traveler with no history has to be
// shown that the app accepts something — and it must not become the way destinations work.
