# American Rider — Traveler App

React Native (Expo SDK 57, expo-router) port of the Claude Design prototype
`../extracted/American Rider - App Prototype v2.dc.html` — treat that file and
`../extracted/CLAUDE.md` as the design source of truth.

**Product vision:** `docs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md` (v1.0) — 99%-to-operator model,
ARTS™ terminology, AI-as-infrastructure, national transportation OS. ARTS terms
(Operator, Travel Number, Commissioned…) govern operator-facing and internal
surfaces; the Traveler UI deliberately uses human words instead (the "Friendly"
decision). "Travel Number"/trip numbers and transparent pricing appear in both.

## Design rules ("Friendly" style)

### THE RUBRIC — ask it of every screen, before shipping anything

> **"Is the design and language on this screen institutional, authoritative, and
> sophisticated?"**

Chad has now given this instruction three separate times (13, 15 and 16 Aug 2026), each
time because a screen shipped that failed it. It is not a mood; it is the acceptance test.
Apply it to EVERY screen and EVERY string, not only the one being worked on.

Concretely, a screen fails the rubric if it:

- **reassures** — "no surge", "no hidden fees", "price won't go up", "don't worry".
  Repeating that a price is trustworthy is what an app does when it expects to be doubted.
  State the price; let it carry itself.
- **editorialises** — "Quiet right now", "A little busy", "Great choice", "You're all set",
  "Almost there". Report the fact and stop.
- **apologises or chats** — "We couldn't work that out just now", "Let's go", exclamation
  marks, emoji, cute status text.
- **names a control after something other than what it does** — "Travel ›" for a link that
  selects; "Reserve Travel" on a button that reserves nothing; a chevron on a row that
  opens nothing.
- **shows a number without saying what it is** — an unlabelled amount, a bare "24 min" that
  could be journey time or operator ETA.
- **contradicts itself about money** — the single most serious defect there is. An amount
  and a doubt about that amount must never render together.
- **uses conversational shorthand where precision exists** — "MIA Airport", "Miami Airport"
  where "Miami International Airport" is what the place is called.

And a screen is NOT made institutional by being stiff: "Pursuant to your travel request"
fails just as hard. The traveler voice is plain English, precisely used.

**THE DESIGN LANGUAGE, in the founders' own words (Adrian + Chad, 6–8 Aug 2026):
institutional, authoritative, sophisticated — carried with clean, minimal, Apple-calm
execution. Chad's directive (8 Aug): apply the three words creatively, everywhere,
design AND language; his web demo (screenshots in chat, 8 Aug) is a reference point.** Apple-clean calm — a non-technical or
elderly person must never feel the app performing at them. Institutional authority comes
from precision and promises, never from jargon or loud visuals. Every new surface —
including web pages the backend serves — must be brand-BUILT (cards, radii, eyebrows,
wordmark lockup), not merely brand-colored, and gets shown to the founders ("what's on it,
what's deliberately not, open style questions") before it ships.

- **THE VISUAL SYSTEM IS THE FOUNDERS' WEB DEMO, EXACTLY** (Chad + Adrian, 8 Aug 2026;
  demo: https://old-scene-d12f.adrianderksmith.workers.dev — shell + traveler-institutional.html).
  Exemplars in code: `app/index.tsx` (home) and `src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx` (front door).
- **THE BLUE STAYS** (Chad, 11 Aug 2026: "we'll keep the blue as it is in the web demo").
  This REVERSES the 8 Aug "no blue anywhere" rule — do not reinstate it. `colors.blue` is
  the demo's `--blue` `#2E5FE0`, used exactly where the demo uses it: View profile ›,
  Travel ›, See all, links, the step bar, and the `blueTint`/`blueBorder` panels. Never
  hardcode a blue hex; never invent a blue the demo does not have.
  **Exceptions Chad made on 13–14 Sept 2026, which stand:** the controls on the Travel
  Confirmation sheet (route dots, class radio, "Modify …" links), the drawer head's "Account
  details ›" (was the blue "View profile ›"), and the search-field caret are INK. The shared
  `blueTint` panels remain as the demo has them until a founder says. The shared `BackLink` is
  INK since 18 Sept 2026: Chad listed "‹ Back" among the blue controls to take the colour off,
  which answered `docs/OPEN-DECISIONS.md` §0.6.
  Chad said for one of them on 15 Sept 2026: the receipt's "Operator retained · 99%" blueTint
  panel is a quiet footer line ("The Operator retained 99% of the travel fare.") — a receipt is
  a transaction record, and the statement belongs at its foot, not in a banner.
- **EVIDENCE IS THE WHOLE PAGE, IN ONE IMAGE.** A screenshot is one phone screen; a screen
  taller than the phone therefore ends wherever the scroll happened to stop, mid-sentence, and
  a founder reading it sees a cut-off app. Chad said so twice (18 Sept 2026: "you are merely
  pasting it incorrectly, therefore it cuts off" — he was right). Capture overlapping frames
  and join them: `swift scripts/stitch-screens.swift out.png <statusBarPx> f0.png f1.png …`,
  which finds each seam by matching pixels and refuses rather than guessing when two frames do
  not overlap. `statusBarPx` is the device's top inset in PIXELS plus a small margin (210 on iPhone 17,
  whose inset is 177): passing it too small leaves a hairline of the masked band drawn across
  the seam, which on the insurance screen fell straight through the Save button. Swipe less than a screen
  between frames — the first attempt at this dropped a whole card out of the middle of the page
  and the stitch looked plausible.
- **MEASURE, DON'T LOOK.** Screenshots are not evidence — three exactness passes failed
  because they were judged by eye. Render the demo (`localhost:8123`) and the app
  (`localhost:8081`) at the same 390 × 844 viewport and diff `getComputedStyle` +
  `getBoundingClientRect` on the same elements. See docs/EXACTNESS-SWEEP.md for the recipe
  and the constant offsets to subtract.
- **Type is pinned.** All text renders through `src/components/AppText.tsx`, never
  `Text` from `react-native` directly. It carries the demo's inherited
  `letter-spacing:-.005em` (RN has no `em` unit) and `allowFontScaling={false}` so iOS
  Dynamic Type cannot resize a layout the demo cannot resize.
- Colors and radii live in `src/theme.ts` — never hardcode. Palette = demo hex-for-hex:
  paper `#F7F7F5`, ink `#14171F`, hairline `#ECEBE6`, border `#E3E2DC`, muted `#8A8A82`,
  faint `#B4B3AB`. Cards: white, radius 16, 1px hairline border, NO shadow. Buttons: radius 13,
  solid-ink primary ("Reserve Travel"), ghost secondary; the only red button anywhere is "Call 911".
- Letterhead header everywhere: hamburger · centered wordmark + NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION
  tagline · thin person-outline icon (never a filled initials circle).
- The menu (Home drawer and the in-travel Menu screen) is THREE GROUPS — Account, Travel,
  Assistance — with the account's name (never a handle minted from the email) and a monochrome
  "Account details ›" at its head; no initials disc; Sign Out in ink (red is Call 911 only);
  no operator recruiting row (operators enter at the front door). Chad, 14 Sept 2026.
- Account details (`app/profile.tsx`) states only what the account knows: the given name
  (editable, saved to Firebase Auth) or the address; the year opened; home, work and up to
  eight favourite destinations (`src/savedPlaces.ts`, on the device, also shortcuts on Home);
  the saved cabin environment (`src/state/cabinPrefs.ts`, applied to every travel); trusted
  contacts; travels completed this year; Payment Methods; the 99% model stated once. No
  honorifics, tiers, bank names, portraits or corporate billing — none exist. Chad + Adrian,
  14 Sept 2026.
- Payment & Settlement (`app/wallet.tsx`) is the traveler's saved methods READ FROM STRIPE
  (`GET/POST/DELETE /payment-methods*` on the server: list, setup-intent for the sheet in
  setup mode, set default, detach), Apple Pay availability, and the Travel Log. Off-session
  charges (gratuity, scheduled travel) use the traveler's chosen default. No corporate billing,
  retainers, statements or expense integrations — none exist. Chad, 14 Sept 2026.
- Section labels: quiet grey letterspaced uppercase (SUGGESTED TRAVEL, RECENT TRAVEL).
  SUGGESTED TRAVEL is EARNED from the traveler's real trips — never shown to a new account.
- IBM Plex Mono is used ONLY for prices and trip/case numbers (the `Mono` component). Everything else is the system font.
- The AI planner ("Plan in your own words") is WITHDRAWN as of 4 Sept 2026 — the founders'
  decision, not shipping at launch, possibly refined and reintroduced later. This line
  previously recorded it as an explicit keep; that is superseded. `app/plan.tsx` and
  `src/backend/assistant.ts` remain in the tree with no entry point, so the work survives
  without a traveler being able to reach it. Do not re-add the link to home without the
  founders saying so.
- Institutional headlines ("Begin Travel"), human words inside the cards; traveler screens
  speak human, operator/business surfaces speak ARTS. Two voices, one company — see
  `docs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md`. The dark "ride in progress" banner keeps its darkness.

## Architecture
- `app/` — one file per screen (expo-router): index (home + drawer), reserve (THE ONE SHEET between a destination and a car — Travel Confirmation: destination entry, route map, departure time, vehicle class with prices, the saved cabin environment, Complete Travel Cost, Confirm Travel; Chad, 14 Sept 2026: "it is subpar to have four screens before a car is on its way" — options.tsx and review.tsx were folded into it and deleted), prefs (Cabin Environment, a sub-screen that returns), ride (live status — named `/ride` because Metro's dev server reserves `/status`), complete (rating/tip), message, receipt, issues (Patron Support), account (Menu), profile, wallet, safety (Safe Travels), settings, notifications, invite, schedule, history (Travel Log), drive (operator recruiting), +not-found.
- `src/state/RideContext.tsx` — single store: booking, live ride progression (2.6s/step demo timer), payments, scheduling, help flows.
- `src/data.ts` — demo data and the fare-display fallback. **Live pricing is server-authoritative.**
  Operator retains 99% of Travel Fare; American Rider receives a 1% uncapped coordination
  commission. The Traveler Platform Fee is no longer a flat fee or percentage schedule:
  `backend/economics.js` computes the smallest whole-cent fee that funds card processing,
  Connect variable/fixed allowances, pass-through processing, a 25c contingency reserve,
  a 25c operating/infrastructure allowance, and at least 75c modeled contribution per
  separately charged Travel. Unknown card country is international-safe; launch currency is
  USD only. `src/data.ts platformFee()` mirrors the integer-cent rule for display fallback,
  and `backend/payments.test.js` checks app/server parity for every cent from $3 to $500.
  Government fees and tolls are pass-through amounts whose induced processing cost is recovered
  by the Platform Fee. The Traveler sees one Total; no payment-processing line is added.
- `src/backend/dispatch.ts` — real in-app dispatch: upserts the Miami fleet to Firestore, matches the nearest available operator, writes the `rides/{tripNo}` doc, and reads the signed-in traveler's rides back (`fetchMyRides`).
- `src/firebase.ts` / `src/state/AuthContext.tsx` — live Firebase Auth + Firestore. The web config in `firebase.ts` is NOT secret; real secrets (e.g. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`) belong only in a backend `.env`, which is gitignored.
- `src/components/LiveMap.tsx` — animated route map (SVG bezier + Animated).
- **Maps (Chad, 13 Sept 2026; supersedes his 9 Sept "iPhone = Apple Maps"): MapLibre, drawn in
  the palette.** `src/components/MonoMap.tsx` (frame, non-interactive, ornaments off, OSM
  attribution beneath), `mapStyle.ts` (theme tokens only; OpenFreeMap tiles as the interim
  source, one URL to swap for self-hosted), `HomeMap.tsx` and `RouteMap.tsx` on iPhone AND
  Android; `*.web.tsx` render nothing (no Google anywhere). Apple Maps (`expo-maps`) remains
  ONLY in `app/pickup-map.ios.tsx` and `src/components/LiveMap.ios.tsx` — an open item, not a
  decision. `@maplibre/maplibre-react-native` is New Architecture only; it needs
  `prebuild --clean`, which `npm run build:sim` does.
- All animations pass `useNativeDriver: useNative` from `src/components/anim.ts` (web fallback).

## Commands
- `npm start` — Metro; scan QR with Expo Go for phone preview.
- `npx expo start --web --port 8081` — browser preview.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — type check; keep it clean.
- `npm run check` — typecheck + the three i18n gates + backend tests, in one command.
- **`npm run i18n` — THE CATALOGUES BEING COMPLETE IS NOT THE SAME AS THE SCREENS USING
  THEM.** Three separate checks, because each one caught something the others could not:
  `check-i18n.mjs` (every language covers every key, and no key is written twice — a
  duplicate silently wins and shadows a correct translation), `check-untranslated.mjs`
  (no user-visible English literal renders without `t()`), `check-unused-i18n.mjs` (no
  key nothing renders — usually a half-done rewire). On 5 Sept 2026 "is it in five
  languages?" answered yes while 84 strings were English on screen; the number only
  became true once these existed. Ask for the count, never the status.
- **Prose lives in more places than JSX text nodes.** Data modules (`src/data.ts`),
  contexts, and `src/backend/*.ts` all hold user-visible sentences. Anything built at
  import time — `TRAVEL_CLASSES`, `VENUE_NOTES`, `INSURERS`, `QUAL_DOCS`, `WHY` — stores
  KEYS, not sentences, because it is evaluated before the stored language is read; the
  RENDER site calls `t()`. Forget that half and the reader sees `traveler.someKey`.
  `AppText` warns in dev when that happens.
- `cd backend && npm run lint && npm test` — **BOTH, and the lint is not optional.** The
  backend is plain JavaScript, so nothing type-checks it. On 29 Aug 2026 the first `no-undef`
  run over `backend/` found two shipped ReferenceErrors that 195 passing tests had not:
  `/operator/disclosure/acknowledge` threw on every call (so every operator who read the
  disclosure was refused when they said so, and none could go on duty), and `sweepAssignments`
  called an undefined `coverageLapsed` inside a `catch { continue }` — swallowing the error and
  silently skipping every re-offer of unanswered travel. Tests prove a module. Lint proves it
  is wired. This codebase's recurring defect is the second thing, not the first.

## Not built yet (see ../extracted/CLAUDE.md roadmap)
Driver (operator) app, real backend, sign-up flow, splash/logo (waiting on logo asset), payments integration.

## Building the app locally (free — no EAS credits)

```
npx expo prebuild --clean -p ios     # regenerates ios/ from app.json; ios/ is gitignored
cd ios && pod install
npx expo run:ios
```

**COCOAPODS NEEDS A UTF-8 LOCALE AND THIS MACHINE HAS NONE.** With `LANG` unset, `pod install`
dies on `Unicode Normalization not appropriate for ASCII-8BIT (Encoding::CompatibilityError)`
several hundred lines into a Ruby backtrace that says nothing about locales. Prefix both
commands:

```
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 npx expo run:ios
```

**THE LIVE ACTIVITY IS A NATIVE TARGET AND NEEDS A PREBUILD.** `expo-widgets` generates an iOS
widget extension from `src/widgets/TravelActivity.tsx` (the `'use widget'` directive). It cannot
run in Expo Go, and adding the plugin does nothing until `npx expo prebuild --clean -p ios`
regenerates the native project. `expo-live-activity` is deprecated — do not reinstate it.

**XCODE 27 BROKE `expo run:ios` FOR SIMULATORS (16 Sept 2026).** The App Store updated Xcode
to 27.0 mid-session. Two consequences. Every Apple tool — `git` included, since /usr/bin/git is
Apple's shim — refuses to run until the new licence is accepted: `sudo xcodebuild -license
accept`, which needs Adrian's password and so is his to run. And `npx expo run:ios --device
<simulator udid>` now stops at "No code signing certificates are available" after a successful
compile: Xcode 27's `simctl list -j` carries `deviceTypeIdentifier` where @expo/cli 57.0.10's
isSimulatorDevice() looks for `deviceType`, so every simulator is taken for a physical iPhone.
`scripts/build-simulator.sh` therefore calls `xcodebuild` directly with the simulator as its
destination (`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`), which is what the CLI does underneath for a simulator,
and finds the .app under DerivedData/AmericanRider-simulator. Proven on e2d030f. The simulators
survived the update (iOS 26.5 runtime intact) but had to be booted again.

**RE-RUN PREBUILD AFTER TOUCHING `plugins` IN app.json.** A config plugin added there does
nothing until the native project is regenerated — `expo-notifications` was in app.json and
absent from Podfile.lock, so push would have failed on a build that looked correct.

**KEEP THE PROJECT AT A PATH WITH NO SPACE IN IT.** It lived at `/Users/adriansmith/American
Rider` until 24 Aug 2026 and the space broke two separate iOS build scripts — expo-constants'
`bash -l -c "$PODS_TARGET_SRCROOT/…"` and React Native's own backtick-executed
`react-native-xcode.sh` — because neither quotes the path it builds. Both died at 99% with

    No such file or directory: /Users/adriansmith/American

naming a directory that does not exist and saying nothing about quoting. Renamed to
`/Users/adriansmith/AmericanRider`, which cures the whole class rather than the two instances
we happened to hit; the next one would have surfaced during an App Store build instead.

`scripts/patch-ios-space-in-path.sh` is kept for anyone who ever builds from a path with a
space. It is NOT wired into `postinstall` any more — the cure is the path.

## Session workflow
- When context usage reaches approximately 70–75%, create a concise delta checkpoint in
  `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` (commits and material work since the last checkpoint, the exact
  stopping point, decisions, tests actually run, the next action) and recommend starting a
  fresh session. Do not wait until the context is full. Do not rerun full tests solely to
  create a handoff. Summarize successful command output rather than reproducing complete logs.
  Commit and push the handoff alone; never bundle unfinished application changes with it.
