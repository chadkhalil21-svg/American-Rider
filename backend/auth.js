 * IT USED TO RETURN THE uid ALONE, and the email was decoded, verified, and thrown away one
 * line before the return. Twelve places in server.js read `req.email`, so all twelve got
 * undefined — including:
 *
 *   - `send({ to: req.email, ... })` in /travel/settle — the Travel Receipt had NO RECIPIENT.
 *     It never sent. /health reported receipts "on", because the key and the from-address were
 *     configured; send() returned "no address for this account" and that was logged, not shown.
 *   - `receipt_email` on every PaymentIntent — so Stripe's own receipt never sent either.
 *   - every Stripe customer created without an email.
 *   - every support case filed without an address to reply to.
 *
 * Both receipt paths, built at both ends, dead for the same missing line. Found 28 Aug 2026 by
 * running the whole loop end to end and reading Stripe's record of what it had been told.
