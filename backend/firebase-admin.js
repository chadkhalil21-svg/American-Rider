// Firebase Admin — the server's own connection to Firestore.
//
// WHY THIS FILE HAD TO EXIST. backend/tickets.js did `require('firebase-admin')` inside a
// try/catch and used `admin.apps.length ? admin.firestore() : false`. Nothing anywhere ever
// called initializeApp, and `firebase-admin` was not in backend/package.json at all — so the
// require threw, the catch swallowed it, `db()` returned false forever, and `fileTicket`
// returned { ok: false } on every case ever filed, in production, since the day it shipped.
//
// The app was honest about it — Patron Support said "We could not open your case
// automatically" and the emergency screen said "Not reached from this device" — which is why
// nobody noticed. Truthful failure reporting made a total outage look like a considered
// edge case. Verifying that a screen tells the truth when a mechanism fails is not the same
// as verifying the mechanism works, and this is the file that closes that gap.
//
// CREDENTIALS. A server cannot use the web config in firebase-config.js; it needs a service
// account. Provide ONE of:
//   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT       the service account JSON, pasted whole into the env var
//   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS a path to that JSON on disk (Google's own convention)
// Generate it at: Firebase console → Project settings → Service accounts → Generate new
// private key. It is a REAL SECRET — it goes in backend/.env (gitignored) and in Render's
// environment, never in the repo.
