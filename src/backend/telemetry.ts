// Where the vehicle is, while it is carrying somebody.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Route monitoring (backend/monitor.js) can only notice a car that has
// stopped if something is telling it where the car is. Nothing was: the app read the phone's
// position for the map, for pricing and for the emergency screen, and never once wrote it to
// the travel. The platform knew a journey was underway and had no idea whether it was moving.
//
// WHAT IS COLLECTED, AND WHEN IT STOPS. Position, only while a travel this operator accepted
// is underway, and only until it ends. Not when they are on duty and empty, not when the app
// is open with no travel, never for a traveler. The operator's own screen says so.
//
// `stillSince` is sent as well as the position because the phone sees a fix every fifteen
// seconds and the server's sweep sees one a minute. The server does not take it on trust —
// see monitor.js, which keeps its own anchor and can only ever shorten the stationary period,
// so no phone can make itself look stuck.
