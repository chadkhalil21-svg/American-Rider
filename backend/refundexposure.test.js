// A REFUND DOES NOT TAKE THE OPERATOR'S MONEY BACK, AND THAT IS WHERE THE LOSS LIVES.
//
// Adrian, 20 Sept 2026: "regarding the refunds you mentioned, we are protected, right? we
// don't want to lose." The honest answer was: partly.
//
// WHAT WAS ALREADY SAFE. A refund cannot exceed the payment, cannot be aimed at a payment
// belonging to another account, cannot be issued against an uncompleted charge, and cannot be
// issued twice — Stripe's own record of what remains refundable is read every time.
//
// WHAT WAS NOT. The operator's 99% leaves at completion and a refund does not reverse it. So
// past the point where our own retained take runs out, every cent given back is money we have
// already paid away and are paying a second time. On a $9.03 travel we keep about $1.58; a
// full refund costs about $7.45. The AI's ceiling was $45 — measured against the size of a
// FARE, which is what a traveler might be owed, not what the company can absorb.
