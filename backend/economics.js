// American Rider — canonical unit economics for one priced Travel.
//
// PURPOSE. The platform fee is not a marketing percentage. It is the smallest whole-cent
// amount that preserves the economic invariant below after the payment processor, Stripe
// Connect, the operating-risk reserve and a per-Travel infrastructure/overhead allowance.
//
// The traveler still sees one Total. These constants and calculations are internal.
//
// PAYMENT ARCHITECTURE
//   * Present and settle in USD only. An international-issued card therefore incurs Stripe's
//     international-card rate, but no Stripe FX conversion is assumed in the payment path.
//   * Unknown card country is costed as international. Under-pricing a first foreign card is
//     not an acceptable "first Travel" exception.
//   * Operators retain 99% of Travel Fare. Tolls are reimbursed whole.
//   * Government fees are remitted whole. Their processing cost is recovered by the platform
//     fee rather than silently absorbed.
//
// COST MODEL, 25 Sept 2026. Monetary values are cents; percentage rates are basis points.
// The $2 monthly active-account cost is recovered separately from the Operator account and is
// waived at 20 completed Travels/month (backend/operatorfees.js). It is therefore NOT charged
// to Travelers here. This model retains only the fixed payout allowance: about 4.33 x $0.25
// scheduled payouts / 20 Travels = 5.4c per Travel, rounded UP to 6c.
//
// IMPORTANT. Costs that cannot yet be known from a quote (e.g. actual TNC corporate insurance,
// legal/accounting retainers) belong in the OPERATING_OVERHEAD allowance once quoted and in the
// corporate budget. The pricing function is intentionally centralized so that changing one
// audited allowance changes every quote and every invariant test together.
