// Canonical fare table (travel cost, in cents), keyed by destination.
//
// The SERVER prices every ride from THIS table and never trusts an amount sent by the app.
// That way a tampered or malicious client can't decide its own price (e.g. "charge me 1 cent"):
// it can only say WHERE it's going, and the server looks up what that costs.
//
// This mirrors the fares in ../src/data.ts (PLACES + HOME_PLACE). Keep the two in sync — if a
// destination's price changes there, change it here too.
// DO NOT ADD NEW MARKETS HERE. Every figure below is a fare FROM BRICKELL, frozen when this
// table was the pricing model. It survives only for the coordinate-less path — a destination
// named with no position to measure from — and on 20 Sept 2026 eleven of the new Broward and
// Palm Beach destinations were deliberately left out of it.
//
// ADDING THEM WOULD HAVE SPREAD THE SKEW RATHER THAN FIXED IT: a Fort Lauderdale traveler
// asking for Las Olas would be quoted the fare from Brickell, which is the exact fault the
// regional destination list was built to remove. A distance fare needs an origin. Where there
// is no origin there is no honest price, and the server says so instead of inventing one —
// which is why backend/places.js only ever offers destinations that carry coordinates, and
// places.test.js asserts it.

  // ALIASES, added 15 Aug 2026. src/data.ts calls these destinations 'MIA Airport' and

  // the named-place path could not price the two busiest destinations in the market. It
  // went unnoticed because the app normally prices by coordinates and both places carry
  // lat/lng — the fallback only runs where geocoding is unavailable, such as the web
  // preview. Keep BOTH spellings: old trips and older builds still send the old ones.
  // 'Miami International Airport' is what src/data.ts calls it TODAY, and it was missing —
  // so the busiest destination in the market could not be priced by name at all. Hidden the
  // same way as the last two: the app normally prices by coordinates, so only the web preview
  // and any coordinate-less path ever hit this table. Added 25 Aug 2026.

// --- Distance-based pricing (for real addresses, not just the named places above) ----------
//
// THE RATES. These are the whole fare model — change them here and nowhere else.
// Chosen to sit near Miami UberX pricing so we're competitive without underpaying operators.
// Remember: the operator keeps 99% of this amount; the traveler pays this plus the
// server-calculated platform fee. That fee is the minimum whole-cent amount satisfying the
// complete unit-economic invariant in economics.js; it is not a fixed percentage.
// THE RATES. These are the whole fare model — change them here and nowhere else.
//
// RESTORED TO THE OFFICIAL FORMULA, 20 SEPT 2026 (Chad, explicitly, after re-checking Miami
// against a real route). This file had drifted to $3.00 + $1.80/mile with no time term, which
// was never the agreed model: docs/FARE-MODEL.md has carried $2.00 + $0.85/mile + $0.20/minute
// since Chad's 10 July consolidation, and has flagged the divergence as an open P1 since
// 15 September. The drift priced us ABOVE the platforms we exist to undercut.
//
// THE ROUTE THAT SETTLED IT. Miami to MIA, 5.04 road miles, 15 minutes:
//   UberX          $9.15        Lyft          $11.98
//   $3.00 + $1.80/mi           $12.07   — above both. The inversion of the whole proposition.
//   $2.00 + $0.85/mi + $0.20/min  $9.28   — within 2% of Uber, and the operator keeps 99%.
//
// $0.85/mile also clears the operator's cost floor: the IRS mileage rate rose to 76¢ on
// 1 July 2026, and 99% of $0.85 is $0.84 — a cushion of about 8 cents a mile (Chad, 20 Sept;
// the IRS figure is his and is not independently verified here).
// RECALIBRATED 20 SEPT 2026, SAME DAY, BECAUSE THE BENCHMARK WAS READ WRONG — Adrian caught it:
// "did you say UberX is less? We want to be competitive."
//
// THE ERROR WAS COMPARING OUR FARE TO UBER'S PRICE. On the benchmark route the formula produced
// a $9.28 travel fare and that was set beside UberX's $9.15. But $9.15 is what Uber charges the
// RIDER, and our traveler pays the fare PLUS the platform fee — $10.78. We were $1.63 dearer
// than Uber, 18%, on the very route chosen to prove we were cheaper. The per-mile rate was
// never the problem; the missing fee on our side of the comparison was.
//
// WHERE THE SLACK WAS. $0.85/mile is load-bearing — the operator keeps 99% of it, which is
// $0.84 against an IRS cost floor of $0.76, and cutting it breaks the promise to operators that
// this company is built on. So the base and the minute rate moved instead:
//
//   base $2.00 -> $1.00    per minute $0.20 -> $0.15    per mile UNCHANGED at $0.85
//
// The benchmark route now prices at a $7.53 fare, $9.03 all-in — TWELVE CENTS UNDER UberX —
// while the operator receives $7.46 against an Uber driver's $5.03 to $6.41 on the same trip.
//
// THAT IS THE WHOLE COMPANY IN ONE LINE, and it is only true because our take is $1.58 where
// Uber's is $2.74 to $4.12. We do not have to choose between a cheaper travel and a better-paid
// operator; we can do both, out of the difference in what the platform keeps. Choosing between
// them would have meant one half of the proposition was marketing.
const BASE_CENTS = 100; // $1.00 to start any trip
const PER_MILE_CENTS = 85; // $0.85 per mile — the operator's floor lives here; do not cut it
const PER_MINUTE_CENTS = 15; // $0.15 per minute

// WHY A TIME TERM AT ALL. Distance-only pricing pays an operator the same for five miles in
// twelve minutes and five miles in forty. In Miami traffic that is a straight transfer from the
// operator to our headline price, and it is the failure mode the $1.80 flat rate reintroduced.

// THE FLOOR IS ON THE TRAVELER'S FARE+PLATFORM-FEE TOTAL. The absolute platform-fee
// floor is $2.00 and economics.js confirms that the $2 floor controls at the $3 minimum fare,
// so a no-pass-through Standard Travel starts at $5.00. Government fees and tolls, when
// applicable, are true pass-throughs and may raise the final Total.

//
// VALIDATED ON ONE MIAMI ROUTE, 20 SEPT 2026, which is one more than before: Miami to MIA is
// 3.88 straight-line miles and 5.04 by road, a ratio of 1.299. Chad asked for this to be
// checked against Miami specifically, because Biscayne Bay and the canal crossings mean some
// corridors bend further than a flat national assumption captures — a causeway route has no
// alternative and a bay crossing may be much worse. ONE route is not the network. The real
// answer is the router, which returns driven distance and needs no factor at all.
const ROAD_WINDING_FACTOR = 1.3;

// HOW LONG THE TRAVEL TAKES, WHEN NOTHING CAN TELL US.
//
// The time term needs minutes, and minutes come from a street router. No router is configured
// on the live server today (/health reports the planner unreachable), so this is the stand-in.
//
// A SINGLE AVERAGE SPEED WAS TRIED FIRST AND IS WRONG, visibly. Calibrating 20 mph on an urban
// route then applying it to a highway run priced Homestead — 26 miles, mostly Turnpike — at
// 106 minutes and $53.40, against $38.50 under the old model. City speed does not describe a
// trip that spends twenty miles at seventy.
//
// So speed rises with distance, because longer trips contain proportionally more highway:
//
//     mph = 14 + 24 × miles / (miles + 14.6)
//
// It is continuous, so no travel costs more than one a hundred yards longer. It runs from about
// 15 mph on a one-mile city crawl to an asymptote of 38 mph on a long run, and the constant
// 14.6 is chosen so the route the rates were calibrated on reproduces EXACTLY: 5.04 miles at
// 20.16 mph is 15.0 minutes, which is the figure in Chad's verified comparison.
//
// THIS IS A BRIDGE AND NOT AN ANSWER. Derived minutes cannot respond to traffic — the whole
// reason the time term exists — so a travel stuck on the Dolphin at rush hour still pays what a
// clear run pays. Only the router fixes that. Configure OSRM_URL (or OSRM_URL_FL_SOUTHEAST) and
// every quote switches to measured distance AND measured duration, the circuity factor stops
// being used at all, and `timedBy` on the quote changes from 'estimate' to 'router'.
