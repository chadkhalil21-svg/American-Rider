// Continue with Apple — the credential, and what Firebase does with it.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. Apple hands back the traveler's name exactly once, on the very
// first authorization, and never again. Firebase stores no name unless we write it in that
// moment, so an account created here and named later reads "Not recorded" on every receipt.
// Keeping the whole exchange in one place is what makes that rule visible.
//
// SETUP THIS NEEDS, and cannot do for itself:
//   1. "Sign In with Apple" enabled on the bundle id com.americanrider.app, in Apple's
//      developer portal. That is Chad's Individual membership; nobody else can enable it.
//   2. Apple enabled as a sign-in provider in the Firebase console, with the Services ID,
//      Team ID, Key ID and the .p8 key.
//   3. `npx expo prebuild -p ios` after the plugin was added to app.json, or the native
//      entitlement is absent and every call fails at the system sheet.
// Until 1 and 2 exist the button is offered only where the device says it can serve it, and
// a failure is reported as what it is rather than as the traveler's mistake.
