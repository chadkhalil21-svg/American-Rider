// Reading an operator's documents.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. `verifyDoc` in src/state/OperatorContext.tsx set a flag to 'checking',
// waited 900 milliseconds, and set it to 'ok'. Driver licence, vehicle registration, annual
// inspection and commercial insurance — every one of them approved by a countdown. Worse than
// it sounds: no image was ever captured, so there was nothing to approve. Five screens said
// "Test program — document review is simulated", which was honest and did not make it safe.
//
// WHERE AI IS ALLOWED TO DO THIS, WHICH IS THE PART THAT MATTERS.
//
// FCRA §603(d)(2)(A)(i) excludes from "consumer report" any report containing information
// SOLELY about transactions or experiences between the consumer and the report-maker. An
// operator hands US their own licence; we read it and decide about our own relationship with
// them. That is first-party, and it is not a consumer report.
//
// CFPB Circular 2024-06 draws the other edge of the same line: a "background dossier" or
// algorithmic score assembled from THIRD-PARTY sources and used for an employment decision IS
// a consumer report, and assembling one could make American Rider a consumer reporting agency
// in its own right. So this file must never do that, and does not:
//
//   IT READS   documents the operator gave us, and compares them with each other and with
//              what the operator told us.
//   IT NEVER   looks anything up about the person, scores them against a population, or
//              consults any source outside this conversation and our own records.
//
// The criminal and driving history stay with a licensed CRA (backend/screening.js) because the
// statute names them and the DPPA governs the driving record. This is the cheap half — the
// half that needs no vendor, and the half a $47.49 report was never going to check anyway.
