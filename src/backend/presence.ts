// STAYING IN SERVICE WITH THE PHONE IN A POCKET.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. An operator's presence was renewed by a setInterval in
// OperatorContext, every 90 seconds, reading foreground location. iOS suspends JavaScript
// timers the moment an app leaves the foreground — so the renewal stopped when the operator
// locked their phone, `onlineAt` went stale, and five minutes later matching.js correctly
// concluded they were not there.
//
// The operator, meanwhile, is sitting at a kerb with the app open in their pocket believing
// they are in service. They receive nothing, they are told nothing, and every explanation
// they reach for — "it's quiet", "the platform is broken", "I've been deprioritised" — is
// wrong. It is the worst failure shape this product has: silent, invisible from both ends,
// and indistinguishable from having no work.
//
// My own comment in backend/matching.js admitted it in August: "iOS suspends timers for a
// backgrounded app, so an operator who leaves the app will go stale even though they are
// there. The real answer is background location, which needs a native capability we have not
// built." This is that capability.
//
// HOW IT WORKS. iOS keeps delivering location to a registered background task after the app
// is suspended, provided the app declares the `location` background mode and holds "always"
// permission. Every delivery is proof the operator's phone is switched on and somewhere — so
// the location update IS the presence renewal. Nothing extra needs to run.
//
// WHY LOCATION RATHER THAN A BACKGROUND FETCH. iOS decides when background fetch runs and can
// be hours apart; it is designed for refreshing content, not for liveness. Location updates
// arrive on movement or on the distance filter, which is exactly the signal we want, and they
// are the same updates dispatch needs anyway to match by distance.
