// The public site: home, the operator page, and support.
//
// WHY THESE THREE. App Store Connect requires a Support URL that a reviewer will open, and a
// Terms page is not support. Stripe lists a business website on the live account. And an
// operator deciding whether to hand over their SSN and bank details looks the company up
// BEFORE they download anything — the operator page is the only surface that reaches them at
// the moment they are deciding.
//
// THE RUBRIC APPLIES HERE EXACTLY AS IT DOES TO EVERY SCREEN. The first draft of this file
// failed it in four ways, all of them the kinds the rubric names:
//
//   · reassured — "it does not change with the weather, the hour, or how busy the city is"
//     is "no surge" at greater length, and "card processing comes out of our share, not yours
//     and not the operator's" defends a position nobody had attacked
//   · editorialised — "everything else is quick", "a job you cannot start"
//     ·  said a thing twice to be believed — "your fare is returned in full. American Rider
//     charges no cancellation fee" is one fact stated as two
//   · addressed the reader as an instruction rather than stating the arrangement
//
// AMERICAN RIDER IS NATIONAL. It begins in Miami; it is not a Miami company, and the wordmark
// says NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION on every surface. The first draft also printed Florida's
// insurance minimums as though they were the requirement everywhere — a correctness defect,
// not a framing one: an operator in another state reading it would be misinformed. Minimums
// are set state by state and are named as Florida's.
//
// The figures are real, verified against Stripe on 19 Aug 2026: a $24.50 travel charges
// $26.00, transfers $24.26, and leaves $1.74. If the fare model changes, change them here.

  <p style="margin-top:16px">The platform fee is added to the fare and charged to the traveler.
  It is never taken from the operator's share, and it is what pays for card processing.</p>
  <p>The commission is 1% of the fare at every amount. A $200.00 travel returns $198.00. There

<section>
  <h2>Cancellations</h2>
  <p>A traveler who cancels before an operator arrives pays nothing, and the operator is owed
  nothing.</p>
  <p>Once an operator has arrived, a cancellation carries a $3.00 arrival fee, and that fee is
  paid to the operator who drove there and waited. A travel that has begun cannot be cancelled
  at all.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Payment</h2>
  <p>On completion of each Travel, American Rider transfers the Operator’s 99% fare share to the Operator’s Stripe connected account. Stripe then pays the connected balance to the Operator’s bank account according to the Operator’s Stripe payout schedule. Bank details remain with Stripe.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Eighteen or older — the age at which an account may be held</li>
    <li>A valid driver license</li>
    <li>A vehicle owned by the operator or authorised for hire</li>
    <li>Commercial for-hire (livery) automobile insurance</li>
    <li>A background check, paid by the operator to the screening company</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Insurance</h2>
  <div class="panel">
    Insurability is established before the background check is paid for. Carriers apply their
    own underwriting, including on age, and coverage that cannot be obtained is work that
    cannot be commissioned. American Rider sets no age limit of its own beyond eighteen.
  </div>
  <p style="margin-top:14px">Each operator must procure and maintain automobile coverage that
  satisfies the requirements applicable to that operator and vehicle. American Rider verifies
  the operator-procured coverage; it does not sell or substitute for that policy. Any coverage
  American Rider may separately be required by law to maintain does not relieve the operator
  of this requirement.</p>
  <p>Minimum limits are set state by state. In Florida they are $1,000,000 in liability while
  carrying a traveler, and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per incident and $25,000 property
  damage while available and unmatched.</p>
  <p>A personal automobile policy may provide no coverage while an operator is logged on or
  carrying a traveler. Most personal policies exclude driving for compensation.</p>
  <p>Coverage is verified before commissioning and on a continuing basis. Travel is not
  assigned while coverage is lapsed or expired.</p>
  <p><strong>Naming American Rider.</strong> Operators ask their agent to add American Rider as
  a certificate holder on the policy. The insurer then sends notice directly if the policy is
  cancelled or not renewed — a cancellation appears on no document, so it is the only way it
  can be known before a travel is assigned against coverage that has ended.</p>
  <p>Certificate holder only. An additional insured is granted coverage under the policy, which
  raises the premium and would state that American Rider is insured under it. It is not, and
  does not ask to be.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Qualification</h2>
  <p>Qualification is completed in the app: driver license, vehicle registration, qualifying
  insurance and the background screening required in the operator's market. American Rider
  verifies commercial coverage and does not sell it.</p>
  <p>In Florida, the screening standard follows Fla. Stat. §627.748. A current check must include
  the required nationwide criminal-record search with primary-source validation of records, the
  National Sex Offender Public Website, and a driving-history report. The statutory
  disqualifications are applied by the same rules to every applicant. A result that does not
  contain enough reliable information to apply those rules is not guessed at and does not pass;
  source clarification or dispute resolution is required before qualification can continue.</p>

  <h2>A travel</h2>
  <p>Patron Support opens from the menu or from the travel itself. It covers travel cost, a

  <p>A lost item is reported from the travel in the Travel Log. The operator who drove the

  $3.00 arrival fee is retained for the operator. A travel already underway is settled through
  Patron Support rather than cancelled.</p>

  <p>The nearest available operator qualified for the class requested is assigned. The

  is not charged for.</p>
