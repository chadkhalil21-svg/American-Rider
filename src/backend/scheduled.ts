// card on the home screen, and nowhere near enough to send anybody. There was no pickup on it,
// no class, no travel number and no fare — so even a server that read the collection could not
// have dispatched from it. The reservation described the appointment; it did not describe the
// journey.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOW: everything backend/scheduler.js needs to match an operator, charge the card
// on file and create the travel, plus the fields the sweep writes back — which is what lets
// the traveler's screen say what has actually happened rather than what was hoped for.
