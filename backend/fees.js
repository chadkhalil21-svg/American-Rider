// NEITHER FARE NOR PLATFORM FEE. The operator does not drive it (so the 99% is not computed on
// it) and American Rider does not keep it (so it is not platform take). payments.quote()
// carries it as passThroughCents; remittance.js sums what is owed to each payee for a month.

// GEOFENCED, NATIONAL BY DESIGN. A fee is a record: where it applies (a box), to which end of
// the travel, how much, who is paid, and the instrument that levies it. The boxes are the OSM
// bounding boxes of the places themselves (Nominatim, read 9 Sept 2026):
//   Miami International Airport   way 113657169 (aeroway=aerodrome)
//                                 lat 25.7829672–25.8081141, lng −80.3190281 – −80.2647351
//   PortMiami / Dodge Island      relation 2168371 (landuse=industrial "Port of Miami"; the
//                                 island, relation 2168370, has the identical box)
//                                 lat 25.7660505–25.7812829, lng −80.1818587 – −80.1450031
// A BOX, NOT THE POLYGON, and that has an edge: the port's box reaches the southern tip of
// Star Island, the airport's the west kerb of LeJeune Road. Both err towards charging a fee
// at a place that is not quite the place. When that matters, store the relation's polygon
// here and test against it; nothing outside this file changes.
//
// The registry is data. Adding a fee is adding a record; nothing else names a fee.

//
// FOUND 20 SEPT 2026, TOURING THE APP AS A TRAVELER. The permit gate built this morning reads
// the FEE registry, so it covered exactly the two places we had troubled to price: MIA and
// PortMiami. Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International was on the traveler's home screen as a
// bookable destination the whole time, and it was NOT refused — because it has no fee record.
//
// THAT IS THE WORSE OF THE TWO FAULTS. A place we decline is a disappointed traveler. A place
// we accept and cannot lawfully serve is an operator sent to an airport without a permit, on
// our instruction, to collect somebody we have taken money from.
//
// BROWARD IS NOT MIAMI-DADE. FLL is a different county, a different authority and a different
// permit; MDAD's directive says nothing about it. We do not hold that permit either, and we do
// not know its fee — so it goes here rather than in the fee registry, which is for money we
// can actually quote. A place may be restricted without us knowing what it would cost.
//
// THE RULE THIS ENCODES, and it is the one to carry into every new market: AN AIRPORT OR
// SEAPORT IS RESTRICTED UNTIL SOMEBODY HAS THE PAPER. Not "unless we find a rule against it" —
// the default for a place run by a public authority with its own ground-transportation regime
// is that we may not work there yet.

// ——— PERMITTED PLACES, AND WHY WE DECLINE THE BUSIEST DESTINATION IN THE MARKET ————
//
// Chad, 20 Sept 2026: "sequence all MIA/PortMiami activity, including drop-offs, as a
// deliberate post-pilot phase. Launch without airport service, prove the core model works."
//
// IT IS NOT ONLY A SEQUENCING PREFERENCE, IT IS THE HONEST ANSWER. Both bodies require a
// permit before a transportation network company may pick up on their property — a three-week
// process with a $1,000 fee and an active LLC as a prerequisite. Without it:
//
//   our operators may not lawfully collect a traveler there, and
//   we would quote a $2.00 fee we have no account to remit it to.
//
// Quoting a government fee to a traveler and then keeping it because nobody has set up the
// remittance is the worst version of this, and it is what happens by default if the fee
// registry is live and the permit is not.
//
// A PLACE IS DECLINED AT BOTH ENDS. Chad included drop-offs deliberately, and the fee schedule
// is the reason the question arises at all: MIA's Exhibit F charges $2.00 to pick up and
// $0.00 to drop off, so a drop-off costs nothing and looks harmless. The permit is not a fee
// waiver — it is permission to operate on the property, and an operator who drops off without
// one is still on that property without one.
//
// TURNING IT ON IS ONE FIELD. Set `permitted: true` on the record when the permit is issued
// and the place becomes bookable at both ends, with its fee already correct. Nothing else
// changes, which is the point: the fee arithmetic has been built and tested since 9 September
// and is waiting rather than being written under time pressure on the day the permit arrives.
